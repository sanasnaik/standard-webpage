# standard-webpage
I created this webpage as an assignment for The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page. 
I used a Linux OS to create this project using HTML and CSS. 
I programmed on VSCode and practiced committing/pushing/fetching changes, and published the final code to GitHub.
